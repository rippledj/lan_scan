# Scan host using TCP Syn
# Scan host using TCP Ack
# Scan host using IP protocol ping
# Scan host using UDP ping
# Scan host UDP services
# Scan for IP protocol

# Stealthy scan
# OS Fingerprinting
# Find TCP ports using TCP ACK scan
# Find TCP ports using TCP Window scan
# TCP ports using TCP Maimon scan


# ### Scan a firewall for security weakness ###
# TCP Null Scan to fool a firewall to generate a response
# TCP Fin scan to check firewall
# TCP Xmas scan to check firewall

# Firewall evasion: Decoy addresses
# Firewall evasion: Idle zombie
# Firewall evasion: Source port
# Firewall evasion: Append Random Data
# Firewall evasion: Scan with Random Order
# Firewall evasion: MAC Address Spoofing

# ### Zenmap Scan Profile ###
# # It comes pre loaded with 10 different scan types which we will take closer look at them in this article.
# # Some of the scan types are kind of obvious, however they may not be to everyone.
# # Timing: -T(x) - Paranoid Sneaky Polite Normal Aggressive Insane
# Intense scan
# Intense scan plus UDP
# Intense scan, all TCP ports
# Intense scan, no ping
# Ping scan
# Quick scan
# Quick scan plus
# Quick traceroute
# Regular scan
# Slow comprehensive scan

# # Nmap Port Selection
# Scan a single TCP port
# Scan a range of TCP ports
# Scan 100 common TCP ports (fast)
# Scan all 65535 TCP ports


# ### Nmap Port Scan types ###
# # Privileged access is required to perform the default SYN scans. If privileges are insufficient a TCP connect scan will be used.
# # A TCP connect requires a full TCP connection to be established and therefore is a slower scan.
# # Ignoring discovery is often required as many firewalls or hosts will not respond to PING, so could be missed unless you select the -Pn parameter.
# # Of course this can make scan times much longer as you could end up sending scan probes to hosts that are not there.
# Scan using TCP connect
# Scan using TCP SYN scan (default)
# Scan a single UDP port
# Scan a range of UDP ports
# Scan all 65535 UDP ports
# Scan selected ports - ignore discovery


# ### Service and OS Detection ###
# # Service and OS detection rely on different methods to determine the operating system or service running on a particular port.
# # The more aggressive service detection is often helpful if there are services running on unusual ports.
# # On the other hand the lighter version of the service will be much faster as it does not really attempt to detect the service simply grabbing the banner of the open service.
# Detect OS and Services
# Standard service detection
# Insane service detection
# Aggressive service detection
# Lighter banner grabbing detection


# ### Digging deeper with NSE Scripts ###
# # According to my Nmap install there are currently 581 NSE scripts. The scripts are able to perform a wide range of security related testing and discovery functions.
# # If you are serious about your network scanning you really should take the time to get familiar with some of them.
# # You will notice I have used the -sV service detection parameter. Generally most NSE scripts will be more effective and you will get better coverage by including service detection.
# Scan using default safe scripts
# Scan using a specific NSE script
# Scan with a set of scripts


# ### A scan to search for DDOS reflection UDP services ###
# # UDP based DDOS reflection attacks are a common problem that network defenders come up against.
# # This is a handy Nmap command that will scan a target list for systems with open UDP services that allow these attacks to take place.
# Scan for UDP DDOS reflectors


# ### HTTP Service Information ###
# # There are many HTTP information gathering scripts, here are a few that are simple but helpful when examining larger networks.
# # Helps in quickly identifying what the HTTP service that is running on the open port. Note the http-enum script is particularly noisy.
# # It is similar to Nikto in that it will attempt to enumerate known paths of web applications and scripts.
# # This will inevitably generated hundreds of 404 HTTP responses in the web server error and access logs.
# Gather page titles from HTTP services
# Get HTTP headers of web services
# Find web apps from known paths


# ### Detect Heartbleed SSL Vulnerability ###
# # Heartbleed detection is one of the available SSL scripts.
# # It will detect the presence of the well known Heartbleed vulnerability in SSL services.
# # Specify alternative ports to test SSL on mail and other protocols (Requires Nmap 6.46).
# Heartbleed testing


# ### IP Address information ###
# # Gather information related to the IP address and netblock owner of the IP address.
# # Uses ASN, whois and geoip location lookups.
# Find Information about IP address
